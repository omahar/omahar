We will have an introduction for the group, open discussion on the current state 
of R as well as two featured presentations. Branden Collingsworth 
will introduce the `purrr` package from the `tidyverse` and Garth Highland 
will showcase the use of functional boxplots.

We also have launched a new [website](https://omahar.netlify.com)
