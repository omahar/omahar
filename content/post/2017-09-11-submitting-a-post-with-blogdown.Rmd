```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
```


## Set up

You will first need to set up an account on [**github**](https://www.github.com) and 
install [**git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Next, make a copy of the repository into your desired workspace. I like to keep
all of my version controlled projects under one directory. Open up a command
terminal of your choosing and use the following:


```{bash}
cd [working directory]
git clone https://github.com/omahar/omahar.git
git branch [new branch]
git checkout [new branch]
git push --set-upstream origin development
```


The [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package is an R interface 
to creating static web pages with Hugo. I will be using the 
[**Rstudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE and 
this package to do the majority of the heavy lifting.


```{r}
devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')
```


## Creating a New Post

You can use the command line to create a new post:

```{r}
blogdown::new_post('Submitting a Post with Blogdown')
```

or you can use the Rstudio addin that is provided:

Blogdown supports both R Markdown or Markdown. You now have a templated
document set up to edit.

## Workflow

```{r, eval = TRUE}
