      <description>Set upYou will first need to set up an account on github and install git.
Next, make a copy of the repository into your desired workspace. I like to keep all of my version controlled projects under one directory. Open up a command terminal of your choosing and use the following:
cd #[working directory]git clone https://github.com/omahar/omahar.gitgit branch #[new branch]git checkout #[new branch]git push --set-upstream origin developmentAfter the initial set up you can open the R Project in Rstudio and use the IDE to handle most of the work you will need to do in git.</description>
